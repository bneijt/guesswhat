Guesswhat
=========

Flow
----
- Enter your name
- Enter your number
- Pick another name from the list and guess his/her number (type in the number)

Person who stays in the game the longest wins.

Possible future work
--------------------
- Remember the number of tries your number has had before being guessed
- Add form validation on the number, with proper error responses
- Create a top score board for longest living numbers
- Disable numbers after they have been guessed (cross out)
- Add a database backend (document based with inplace updates? MongoDB possibly)
- Use an html to widget library to couple the json queries in a more proper way (like GWT?)
- Keep a name from being reset before it has been guessed
